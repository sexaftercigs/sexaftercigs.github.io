welcome to my virtual brain dump! my plan with this was to experiment with github pages, as well as document my journey through life.
from learning to code, learning how to detach from my phone and social media, or just random shit i wanna write about for the day. i don't intend on
people really seeing this, but a place for me to look back on without my shitty handwriting.
